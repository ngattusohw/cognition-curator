## TODO

- Fix Apple login flow - user stays on login screen after successful 200 response when creating new user, should automatically redirect into the app
- Make daily and accuracy trends in the learning trends section display actual data instead of placeholder/empty charts
- Improve UX when clicking delete during AI generated deck review - show a card reject/deleted toast and make it clear we're going to next card for review

## COMPLETE
