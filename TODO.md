## TODO

- Fix Apple login flow - user stays on login screen after successful 200 response when creating new user, should automatically redirect into the app
- home button when on the deck screen doesnt work
- should have the ability to silence a deck to stop showing the cards from it
- fix retry in the ai gen review -- adds variation 1 a bunch

## COMPLETE

- Improve UX when clicking delete during AI generated deck review - show a card reject/deleted toast and make it clear we're going to next card for review
- shuffle the cards
- Make daily and accuracy trends in the learning trends section display actual data instead of placeholder/empty charts
- Fix Recent Activity section to show meaningful user activities instead of "no activity"
