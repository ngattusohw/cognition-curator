## User Flows

### 1. Onboarding
- New user creates their first deck
- Guided through adding initial flashcards
- Introduced to spaced repetition concept

### 2. Daily Review
- User opens app and sees cards due for review
- 5-minute timeboxed review session
- Tap to reveal answers, rate difficulty
- SM-2 algorithm calculates next review date

### 3. Deck Management
- Create new decks manually or with AI
- Add/edit/remove flashcards
- Organize with superset decks
- Search and filter functionality

### 4. Progress Tracking
- View learning statistics
- Track streaks and accuracy
- Monitor study time and trends

## Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The app implements the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm:

- **Again (0)**: Reset interval to 1 day
- **Hard (1)**: Multiply interval by 1.2
- **Good (2)**: Multiply interval by ease factor (default 2.5)
- **Easy (3)**: Multiply interval by ease factor √ó 1.3

## API Integration

The app includes a protocol-based API service for future LangGraph integration:

```swift
protocol FlashcardAPIService {
    func generateDeck(topic: String) async throws -> [Flashcard]
    func enhanceCard(card: Flashcard) async throws -> Flashcard
}
```

## Design Principles

### UI/UX
- **Clean & Modern**: Minimalist design with thoughtful spacing
- **Smooth Animations**: Tasteful transitions and micro-interactions
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type
- **Dark Mode**: Full system appearance support

### Code Quality
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Testable and extensible
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Business logic (spaced repetition algorithm)
- Data model validation
- Service layer functionality

### Integration Tests
- Core Data operations
- CloudKit sync (premium)
- API integration

### UI Tests
- Onboarding flow
- Card review process
- Deck management

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Cards loaded on demand
- **Background Processing**: Core Data operations off main thread
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of large datasets
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient background sync

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Push notifications for review reminders
- [ ] Offline mode improvements
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Bulk import/export

### Long Term
- [ ] Advanced spaced repetition algorithms
- [ ] Social features (shared decks)
- [ ] Gamification elements
- [ ] Machine learning insights
